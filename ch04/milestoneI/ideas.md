[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

Health and Wellness. A website that has information on health, tips, and videos. Users can create an account to track their health data. They can also chat will other users with them about tips and create a community.

## Project Idea 2
Clothing. A simulator that creates outfits for the day/week based off what you have in your closet. It can randomly choose or the user can input a color or style and sort their clothes. 

## Project Idea 3
Shopping. Users can use the website to shop for certain clothing. They can choose which stores they want to search through and pick from there. For example, they might need a yellow dress from H&M, Forever 21, and Hollister. It would merge all the yellow dresses from those websites. Saves time and tabs.
